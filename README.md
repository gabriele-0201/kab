have to understand with the debugger if the interrupt entry 0x20 is understanded and is possible to set a break point on it
otherwise have to understand why the idt is not loaded correctly

-> all in one asm seems to work, now the problem if of course the idt (before try with gdb if the HandleInterruptRequest0x00 is triggered or not)
